            <h2><center>Causes of World Hunger</center></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Economic Factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Poverty:</strong> Poverty is the primary driver of hunger. Individuals and families living in poverty often lack the resources to purchase food or grow their own. They also lack access to essential services such as healthcare, which can further exacerbate food insecurity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Unemployment and Low Wages:</strong> High unemployment rates and low wages limit people's ability to buy food. In many developing countries, even if food is available, it might not be affordable for a significant portion of the population.</p>
                    <p><strong>Inequality:</strong> Economic inequality, both within and between countries, means that while some people have more than enough resources, others do not have enough to meet their basic needs. This disparity often leaves the most vulnerable without access to sufficient food.</p></li>
            
                <li>
                    <h3>Social Factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Population Growth:</strong> Rapid population growth can strain local food supplies and make it difficult to achieve food security. In some regions, the population grows faster than food production, leading to shortages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Education:</strong> Lack of education, particularly among women, can contribute to food insecurity. Education improves employment opportunities and income, and educated individuals are more likely to implement effective agricultural practices and nutrition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Health:</strong> Health issues, including diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria, can reduce people's ability to work and earn a living, thus impacting their ability to buy food. Poor health also increases vulnerability to hunger.</p>
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    <h3>Political Factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Conflict and War:</strong> Armed conflict and political instability disrupt food production and distribution. Wars can displace large numbers of people, destroy infrastructure, and make farming impossible. Conflict also diverts resources away from development and towards military spending.</p>
                    <p><strong>Government Policies:</strong> Poor governance and ineffective policies can contribute to hunger. Corruption, lack of investment in agriculture, and inadequate social safety nets leave many without access to food. Trade policies that disadvantage local farmers can also exacerbate food insecurity.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Environmental Factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Climate change affects food production through increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events like droughts and floods. These changes can reduce crop yields and disrupt food supplies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods can destroy crops, livestock, and infrastructure, leading to immediate and long-term food shortages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Degradation of Natural Resources:</strong> Overuse and degradation of land, water, and other natural resources reduce the capacity to produce food. Soil erosion, deforestation, and water scarcity are critical issues affecting agricultural productivity.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Agricultural Factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Agricultural Practices:</strong> Traditional farming practices may not be sustainable or efficient enough to meet the growing demand for food. Issues such as poor soil management, lack of access to modern farming technology, and reliance on rain-fed agriculture can limit productivity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lack of Infrastructure:</strong> Inadequate infrastructure, including roads, storage facilities, and markets, hampers the distribution of food. Without proper infrastructure, it is difficult to get food from farms to markets and consumers, leading to waste and shortages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Market Access:</strong> Smallholder farmers often face challenges in accessing markets where they can sell their produce at fair prices. Limited market access reduces their income and ability to invest in better farming practices.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Interconnectedness of Factors</h3>
                    <p>These factors do not operate in isolation; they are interconnected and often exacerbate each other. For instance, poverty can lead to poor health, which in turn can reduce an individual's ability to work and earn an income, further entrenching poverty and food insecurity. Similarly, conflict can exacerbate poverty, disrupt education, and lead to environmental degradation.</p>
